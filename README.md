# hello-world
This is my Hello World repository for CSC 430.
Hello, my name is John Tucker Vaughan, but I go by Tucker generally. I am 22 years old, and I like to hang out with my friends, play video games, and learn about science and philosophy. In addition, I also enjoy sharing and discussing what I have learned with other individuals to hear their viewpoints on the subjects that I study.
